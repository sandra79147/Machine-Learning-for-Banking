<font size="3"><strong>Description of the problem</strong></font>  
Banks offer various kinds of accounts and provide loans based on the requirements.

The process, defined as ‘risk-based pricing’, uses a sophisticated algorithm that leverages different determining factors of a loan applicant. Selection of significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can estimate loan interest rates based on clients’ information. On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on clients information. Here, your goal is to use a training dataset to predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3) that will be assigned to each loan in our test set.

You can use any combination of the features in the dataset to make your loan rate category predictions. Some features will be easier to use than others.

<font size="3"><strong>My goal:</strong></font>
The goal of problem is to predict the  loan rate rate categories (1-3) for each data based on the sets provided on the page. In this project I would like compare the accurancy of diffrent machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees or Naive Bayesian classifier and select the best of them for this problem.

<strong>Algorithms used:</strong> Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayesian classifier, Multiple imputation
